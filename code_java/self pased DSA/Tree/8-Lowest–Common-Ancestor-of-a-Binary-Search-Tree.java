/**
 * Problem Summary:
 * Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes p and q.
 * The LCA is defined as the lowest node in the BST that has both p and q as descendants
 * (a node can be a descendant of itself).
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Traverse the tree from root to find the path for node p.
 * 2. Traverse the tree from root to find the path for node q.
 * 3. Store these paths in two separate lists.
 * 4. Use a HashSet to store nodes from the path of p for quick lookup.
 * 5. Traverse the path of q from the end towards the start and find the first node
 *    that is also present in the path of p â€” this node is the LCA.
 *
 * This approach works by explicitly storing the paths to both nodes and then
 * finding the deepest common node on these paths.
