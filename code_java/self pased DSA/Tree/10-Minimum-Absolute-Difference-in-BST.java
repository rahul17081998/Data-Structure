/**
 * Problem Summary:
 * ----------------
 * We are given a Binary Search Tree (BST), and we want to find the minimum absolute difference
 * between values of any two nodes in that tree.
 *
 * Why is this problem interesting?
 * - The BST property guarantees that for any node, all nodes in the left subtree are smaller
 *   and all nodes in the right subtree are larger.
 * - This sorted order of nodes can be exploited to find minimum differences efficiently.
 *
 * Algorithm and Approach:
 * -----------------------
 * 1. In-order traversal of a BST:
 *    - Visiting nodes in the order: left child -> node -> right child.
 *    - This traversal produces nodes in sorted ascending order.
 *    - So, if we list out node values during in-order traversal, the list will be sorted.
 *
 * 2. Minimum difference in a sorted list:
 *    - The minimum absolute difference between any two numbers in a sorted list
 *      must be found between some pair of adjacent elements.
 *    - Hence, we only need to check consecutive nodes during the traversal instead of all pairs.
 *
 * 3. Tracking state during traversal:
 *    - Maintain a variable `lastNodeValue` to store the value of the previously visited node.
 *    - Maintain `minDiff` initialized to a large value (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE).
 *    - For each node visited:
 *       * Calculate the difference between current node's value and `lastNodeValue`.
 *       * Update `minDiff` if the current difference is smaller.
 *       * Update `lastNodeValue` to current nodeâ€™s value.
 *
 * 4. Result:
 *    - After the traversal completes, `minDiff` holds the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes.
 *
 * Why This Works:
 * ---------------
 * - Because the BST in-order traversal outputs sorted values, checking adjacent nodes guarantees
 *   that no smaller difference exists beyond these neighbors.
 * - If we compared non-adjacent nodes, the difference would only be equal or larger.
 * - This reduces a potential O(n^2) problem (checking all pairs) to O(n).
 *
 * Complexity:
 * -----------
 * - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
 * - Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to recursion stack space.
