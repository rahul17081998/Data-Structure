/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * You are given an undirected, connected, and weighted graph with V vertices and E edges represented as an edge list.
 * Your task is to implement Prim's Algorithm to find the cost of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
 *
 * About Prim's Algorithm:
 * Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, and weighted graph.
 * The MST is a subset of edges that connects all vertices in the graph with the minimum possible total edge weight and without any cycles.
 * Primâ€™s Algorithm works by starting from an arbitrary vertex and expanding the MST one vertex at a time by choosing the smallest edge
 * that connects a new vertex to the growing MST.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * V = 5
 * edges = {
 *   {0, 1, 2},
 *   {0, 2, 1},
 *   {1, 2, 1},
 *   {2, 3, 2},
 *   {3, 4, 1},
 *   {4, 2, 2}
 * }
 *
 * Output:
 * Minimum cost to connect all vertices of MST: 5
 *
 * Approach for Implementation:
 * 1. Convert the edge list into an adjacency list for efficient graph traversal.
 * 2. Use a PriorityQueue (min-heap) to always pick the next edge with the minimum weight.
 * 3. Maintain a visited array to track which nodes have already been included in the MST.
 * 4. Start from an arbitrary node (commonly node 0) and push its adjacent edges into the priority queue.
 * 5. At each step, pick the smallest weight edge that connects a new node to the growing MST.
 * 6. Repeat until all nodes are visited and included in the MST.
