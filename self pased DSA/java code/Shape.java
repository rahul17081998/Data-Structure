public interface Shape {

/*Create a Java interface called Shape. The Shape interface should have the following methods:
•	getArea(): This method should return the area of the shape.
•	getPerimeter(): This method should return the perimeter of the shape.

Create two classes that implement the Shape interface called Circle and Rectangle. 
The Circle class should have a radius attribute, and the Rectangle class should have a width and height attribute.
The Circle class should override the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle. 
The Rectangle class should override the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
